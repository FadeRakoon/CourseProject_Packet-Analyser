# CourseProject_Packet-Analyser
The super-secret shady government organization (SSSGO) that you work for has decided to create 
their very own super shady packet sniffer (SSPS) to keep track of the packets that flow through its 
network. With this tool, they will be able to analyse the network activity on their network and 
observe signs of a potential cyber-attack before it happens. They may or may not use it to spy on 
citizens but thatâ€™s above your paygrade.
